                    <p class="lorem">Lorem Ipsum is placeholder text commonly used in printing and design. In fact, 
                        Lorem Ipsum has been the standard placeholder text since the 16th century when an unknown printer 
                        took a font specimen book and scrambled it to create a type specimen. This "fish" not only 
                        successfully survived five centuries but also adapted well to electronic typesetting, essentially 
                        remaining unchanged. It gained popularity in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing 
                        passages of Lorem Ipsum and, more recently, with desktop publishing software like Aldus Pagemaker, 
                        which included various versions of Lorem Ipsum.
